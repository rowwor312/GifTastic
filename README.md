GIPHY Activity

The assignment required the student to create an application allowing the user to search
for images per a selected category.

Students were to incorporate Giphy API into the assignment. Utilizing AJAX to get the data.
Also, the students were to setup the app using a selected theme of their choosing - I selected a
Sports' Theme.

The APP:
I created an array of five action buttons that load initially on the page.

When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
When you click an image, it plays. When you click the image a second time, it stops playing.

A new action button can be added from the form located on the right side of the page. 
The new button will be added to the current list of buttons on the page.
Also provided for each image is it's rating. Which appears on the page below it's image.
